# Systems Programming and Operating System Practical Assignments

## Group A

| Expt. No. | Problem Statement | Link |
|-----------|--------------------|------|
| **A1-01** | Design suitable Data structures and implement Pass-I of a two-pass assembler for a pseudo-machine. Implementation should consist of a few instructions from each category and a few assembler directives. | [Link](https://github.com/nirz306/Pict_Lab/blob/main/TE/Sem1/LP/1_passOne.cpp) |
| **A1-02** | Design suitable Data structures and implement Pass-II of a two-pass assembler for a pseudo-machine. The output of Pass-I (intermediate code file, symbol table, and literal table) should be input for Pass-II. | [A1-02_Link](#) |
| **A2-01** | Design suitable data structures and implement Pass-I of a two-pass macro-processor. | [A2-01_Link](#) |
| **A2-02** | Design suitable data structures and implement Pass-II of a two-pass macro-processor. The output of Pass-I (MNT, MDT, and intermediate code file without any macro definitions) should be input for Pass-II. | [A2-02_Link](#) |

## Group B (Any Two Assignments from Sr. No. 4 to 7)
**Programming language: C / C++ / JAVA / Python**

| Expt. No. | Problem Statement | Link |
|-----------|--------------------|------|
| **B1** | Write a program to solve Classical Problems of Synchronization using Mutex and Semaphore. | [B1_Link](#) |
| **B2** | Write a program to simulate CPU Scheduling Algorithms: FCFS, SJF (Preemptive), Priority (Non-Preemptive), and Round Robin (Preemptive). | [B2_Link](#) |
| **B3** | Write a program to simulate Memory placement strategies â€“ best fit, first fit, next fit, and worst fit. | [B3_Link](#) |
| **B4** | Write a program to simulate Page replacement algorithms. | [B4_Link](#) |
